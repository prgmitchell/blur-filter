# blur-filter
The blur filter from the StreamFX plugin packaged on its own.

I take zero credit for the source code provided on this repository. This is just the blur filter from the StreamFX plugin for
those who want a standalone version. All credit goes to the original author Xaymar.

**I will not be taking any change requests or guaranteeing any support/bug fixes**.

Installation:

* Windows
1) Download and run the .msi installer.
2) Select your obs-studio installation folder, the default is already set as C:\Program Files\obs-studio.
3) Open OBS and add a "Blur" filter to whatever source you want to blur.

* MacOS
1) Download and run the .pkg installer.
